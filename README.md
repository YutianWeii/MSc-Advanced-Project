ðŸ“… In the first week, I determined the project theme and established contact with my supervisor, Adam Cole. Here is the initial project concept I wrote: In the second week, I scheduled our first meeting with Adam and prepared for it.

I want to continue researching "AI as an Art Audience" based on my previous paper. If you're interested, please visit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/45cheoq7m0bvucc/Final%20essay-Yutian%20Wei.pdf?dl=0
From a Post-humanist perspective, the line between non-human and human is blurred. However, most artworks today are created for human viewers. I believe considering non-human entities as art audiences will bring new possibilities, elevating AI from a tool to a viewer itself. I have two ideas now: 1.Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially involving the differences in how different AI models perceive things. 2.Presenting the content that AI could potentially "see" to humans. This allows humans to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship. The artwork may involve a combination of AI algorithms, VR, and other techniques.

ðŸ“… In the second week, I chose art experimentation as my research methodology, primarily focusing on the different cognition between AI and human beings. The artwork might take the form of an interactive installation:
1. Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially exploring how different AI models perceive things differently.
2.Presenting the content that AI could "see" to humans, allowing them to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship.
I believe that human understanding of AI is likely one-sided, and I cannot truly approach their way of thinking. On the technical side, I researched t-SNE (https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). I also referred to the art piece Bec0m1ng (https://www.posthumanart.com/post/bec0m1ng-a-speculative-exploration-of-ai-beyond-cognition-and-towards-presence), which consists of a digital environment with a fixed amount of matter and a group of AI agents.

ðŸ“… In the third week, I met with Adam to discuss my ideas. He advised me to consider specific research questions and recommended related artworks AICCA (https://hypebeast.com/2023/6/aicca-robotic-dog-mario-klingemann-coleccion-solo) and the scholar Joanna (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/joanna-zylinska, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASV6Hjd2bY). We also discussed what genres of art AI audiences would view. Lastly, I read the submission requirements for the graduation project.

ðŸ“… In the fourth week, I read articles written by Joanna and watched videos. Here are the key terms I wrote during my thought process:

AI Aesthetics, evaluating the quality of artworks

Objective: Humans should treat AI equally and broaden their perspectives

Art from the AI's point of view or AI's response to art

Presenting art through the AI's eyes (the process)

An AI system's "cognition" is entirely dependent on its programming and training data, and they can only perform well in specific tasks.

Most current ML artworks use AI as a tool for artistic effects. I aim to make AI both the subject and purpose of art, creating artworks for AI. However, AI may not truly appreciate art; my goal is for the audience to treat non-human entities equally and include them as service recipients rather than just as tools.

How to transform artworks into a form that AI can appreciate?

AI sees the form but not the content

I make artworks for AI, AI makes artworks for itself

One-dimensional: sound, sequence; Two-dimensional: image; Three-dimensional: space; Multi-dimensional

Through AI, we can uncover hidden structures in one-dimensional data, then display and analyze these structures in higher-dimensional spaces.

AI's shared language: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/what-an-ais-non-human-language-actually-looks-like/530934/, https://thenewstack.io/ai-bots-create-language-communicate/


Questions:
What aspects of artworks can AI appreciate? Form/Pattern/Meaning/Emotion/Similarity.

What forms can AI perceive? Digital/High-dimensional structures/Hidden information.

Is AI viewing art generated by AI or by humans?

How can artworks be transformed into a form that AI can appreciate?

In my work, should I borrow and transform famous artworks or create new pieces for transformation?

Will the visible form of artworks differ for different AI models?

Meaningless imagesâ€”revealed through AI algorithm processing.

What are non-human made AIs like, such as crows?

What type of artworks attract AI the most? Those with strong contrasts, sequences, specific frequencies, highly regular or irregular patterns.

Is the AI's generation process also a viewing process?

Gaussian images + steganographyâ€”only AI can discern the information, reversing the process of ML art.

(Text or image information hidden in pictures through technology, undetectable by humans) Inputting AI-processed images to obtain information.

High-dimensional spaces, t-SNE.

AI's aesthetic assessment relies on datasets, which may lead to biases.
The visual presentation and textual description of an artwork, when separately analyzed and understood by AI, could result in significantly different interpretations (the division in understanding the artwork and the description).
