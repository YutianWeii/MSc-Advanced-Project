### June 2023
üìÖ In the first week, I determined the project theme and established contact with my supervisor, Adam Cole. I scheduled our first meeting with Adam and prepared for it. Here is the initial project concept I wrote:
I want to continue researching "AI as an Art Audience" based on my previous paper. If you're interested, please visit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/45cheoq7m0bvucc/Final%20essay-Yutian%20Wei.pdf?dl=0
From a Post-humanist perspective, the line between non-human and human is blurred. However, most artworks today are created for human viewers. I believe considering non-human entities as art audiences will bring new possibilities, elevating AI from a tool to a viewer itself. I have two ideas now: 1.Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially involving the differences in how different AI models perceive things. 2.Presenting the content that AI could potentially "see" to humans. This allows humans to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship. The artwork may involve a combination of AI algorithms, VR, and other techniques.

üìÖ In the second week, I chose art experimentation as my research methodology, primarily focusing on the different cognition between AI and human beings. The artwork might take the form of an interactive installation:
1. Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially exploring how different AI models perceive things differently.
2.Presenting the content that AI could "see" to humans, allowing them to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship.
I believe that human understanding of AI is likely one-sided, and I cannot truly approach their way of thinking. On the technical side, I researched t-SNE (https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). I also referred to the art piece Bec0m1ng (https://www.posthumanart.com/post/bec0m1ng-a-speculative-exploration-of-ai-beyond-cognition-and-towards-presence), which consists of a digital environment with a fixed amount of matter and a group of AI agents.

üìÖ In the third week, I met with Adam to discuss my ideas. He advised me to consider specific research questions and recommended related artworks AICCA (https://hypebeast.com/2023/6/aicca-robotic-dog-mario-klingemann-coleccion-solo) and the scholar Joanna (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/joanna-zylinska, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASV6Hjd2bY). We also discussed what genres of art AI audiences would view. Lastly, I read the submission requirements for the graduation project.

üìÖ In the fourth week, I read articles written by Joanna and watched videos. Here are the key terms I wrote during my thought process:
AI Aesthetics, evaluating the quality of artworks
Objective: Humans should treat AI equally and broaden their perspectives
Art from the AI's point of view or AI's response to art
Presenting art through the AI's eyes (the process)
An AI system's "cognition" is entirely dependent on its programming and training data, and they can only perform well in specific tasks.
Most current ML artworks use AI as a tool for artistic effects. I aim to make AI both the subject and purpose of art, creating artworks for AI. However, AI may not truly appreciate art; my goal is for the audience to treat non-human entities equally and include them as service recipients rather than just as tools.
How to transform artworks into a form that AI can appreciate?
AI sees the form but not the content
I make artworks for AI, AI makes artworks for itself
One-dimensional: sound, sequence; Two-dimensional: image; Three-dimensional: space; Multi-dimensional
Through AI, we can uncover hidden structures in one-dimensional data, then display and analyze these structures in higher-dimensional spaces.
AI's shared language: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/what-an-ais-non-human-language-actually-looks-like/530934/, https://thenewstack.io/ai-bots-create-language-communicate/

Questions:
What aspects of artworks can AI appreciate? Form/Pattern/Meaning/Emotion/Similarity.
What forms can AI perceive? Digital/High-dimensional structures/Hidden information.
Is AI viewing art generated by AI or by humans?
How can artworks be transformed into a form that AI can appreciate?
In my work, should I borrow and transform famous artworks or create new pieces for transformation?
Will the visible form of artworks differ for different AI models?
Meaningless images‚Äîrevealed through AI algorithm processing.
What are non-human made AIs like, such as crows?
What type of artworks attract AI the most? Those with strong contrasts, sequences, specific frequencies, highly regular or irregular patterns.
Is the AI's generation process also a viewing process?

AI's aesthetic assessment relies on datasets, which may lead to biases.
The visual presentation and textual description of an artwork, when separately analyzed and understood by AI, could result in significantly different interpretations (the division in understanding the artwork and the description).


### July 2023
üìÖ In the first week of July, I had my second meeting with Adam. Here is the outline of my report: 
Research question: Exploring the presentation forms of artworks when AI acts as an art audience.
Research methodology: Art experiments.
From the perspective of the form of artwork presentation:
1„ÄÅHow to transform artworks into a form that AI can understand?
2„ÄÅExperiment with creating art in the forms of images, text, and music that only AI can understand. They are meaningless in human world but meaningful in AI world.

From the perspective of AI's feedback results: 
1„ÄÅWhat type of work attracts AI the most? Those with high contrast, sequential, specific frequencies, highly regular or irregular ones? different with human preference. 
2„ÄÅAI‚Äôs aesthetic evaluation depends on datasets, which may lead to biases. 
3„ÄÅFor an artwork's visual presentation and textual description, separate analyses and understanding by AI might lead to vastly different results. For AI, perhaps words are more specific and easier to understand? 
4„ÄÅDoes AI understand human-created art and AI-generated art differently? Extended thinking: Could AI potentially create art for itself?
Relevant work: Color of Words (https://genekogan.com/works/color-of-words/)
Technical references: t-SNE: https://mlart.co/?page=1&search=t-SNE, https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/

Adam recommended the work Botto (https://www.botto.com/) and the books Ways of Being (https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being/) and AI Art (http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/ai-art/). He suggested I frame my thesis question as, "How can novel forms of artistic presentation help humans understand AI, with AI as the audience?" Technically, he advised me to try GANs, Autoencoders, and Diffusion models, and perhaps print out the latent space from the Diffusion models.

üìÖ The second week I went on a trip. üõ´

üìÖ In the third week, I read the book AI Art: Machine Visions and Warped Dreams. Here are some excerpts from my reading:

Does art exist outside the clearly designated realm of human cultural practice? Will ai create new conditions and new audiences for art? What will art ‚Äòafter‚Äô ai look like? Who will be its recipient?
Questions of originality and of the genius of an individual producer are hence framed by a study of the wider context that produces conditions for the emergence of a particular art form ‚Äì and that produces particular audiences which can identify, interpret and engage with that art form. These questions are therefore framed through what Michel Foucault has called an ‚Äòauthor function‚Äô (1992, 306): a wider discursive arrangement that stabilises into what a given cultural moment perceives as an ‚Äòauthor‚Äô or ‚Äòartist‚Äô.
call ‚Äòai imitation work‚Äô, also known as ‚Äòstyle transfer‚Äô. This mode of artistic production departs from the classical conceptualisation of art in terms of mimesis, i.e. the imitation of nature and its representation. For aristotle, all art was mimetic, but mimesis, proceeding by addition and not just repetition, involved what we would today call a ‚Äòremediation‚Äô (Bolter and Grusin 2002) of nature. it was thus a form of creative engagement, although one that was not yet linked to the humanist notions of originality and genius. Unlike mimesis, ‚Äòstyle transfer‚Äô is pure mimicry: a belaboured resemblance which is also a masquerade. in the context of the ai industry, where much of this kind of mimicry art is being produced, we need to ask: what underpins those efforts and what is it they actually attempt to masquerade as?
The ‚Äòcomputer‚Äô, be it in the shape of a data-processing machine, a robot or an algorithm, is only seen here as an imperfect approximation of such a human. But, in light of the argument laid out here, we should rather be asking, after Flusser, whether the human can actually be creative, or, more precisely: in what way can the human be creative?
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

üìÖ In the fourth week, I continued reading books and literature. Here are some excerpts from my reading:

Dukaj goes so far as to suggest that, in the times of ai, human life is the only auratic form of art left to us, especially the way it escapes the digital record- ing and preprogrammed behaviour. he is not talking here about some unmediated encounter between two humans outside the technological setup or evoking similar humanist fantasies. it is the YouTube stars, pub- licising their lives and the branded products that shape them, that are for him the last artists of today, turn- ing lifestyle into an aesthetic experience while also externalising the knowledge about what it means to be human, and to behave like a human being, into the globally interconnected computer network. 
This form of art enforces what Berardi has described as ‚Äòmental subsumption‚Äô (2017), whereby the automation of vision and of cognitive activity paves the way for the emergence of constantly stimulated yet passive subjectivity. it thus ultimately works in the service of neoliberal- ism, a mutated form of capitalism that, according to Byungchul han, ‚Äòhas discovered the psyche as a productive force‚Äô. Yet what gets produced here is ‚Äòmental optimisation‚Äô (han 2017), for which Big data, algorithms and ai serve as perfect conduits. han calls this state of events a psychopolitics, which is his variation on Foucault‚Äôs notion of biopolitics, whereby the subject mobilises technologies of the self not to create any forms of freedom but rather to succumb, ‚Äòwillingly ‚Äì and even passionately‚Äô (2017), to auto-exploitation (fig. 9)
seeing like a Machine, Telling like a human
What is new about the FereT images is that they are not aimed at human eyes: as a training set for a facial recognition algorithm, their goal is to establish this commonality-in-difference for machine vision. indeed, these images are not meant to be seen at all by humans but are rather going inside the black box that ai has become. The fact that most ai research has been funded by the military, with darpa, the original funders of internet development, also sponsoring ‚Äòmore ai research than private corporations and any other branch of the government‚Äô (Barrat 2013, 180) 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶


### August 2023
üìÖ In the first week, I read books and literature. Here are some excerpts from my reading:
From ‚ÄòApple‚Äô to ‚ÄòAnomaly‚Äô can thus be positioned as one of the seeing machines analysed elsewhere by the artist ‚Äì not because it sees anything by itself or even approximates the way machines see, but rather because ‚Äòmachines become autonomous systems that intervene and are coercive in the world‚Äô (clark 2019). it thus symbolises a larger infrastructure of perception and cognition which is currently being constructed at different scales ‚Äì and which, arguably, will soon change our ways of being in the world, as individuals and as citizens.

For me, the concept of ‚Äònonhuman photography‚Äô refers to photo- graphs that are not of, by or for the human (see Zylinska 2017, 5), encompassing images as diverse as depopulated vistas, satellite pictures and Qr codes. even though the opening premise of Nonhuman Photography is that today, in the age of ccTV, drone media, medical body scans and satellite imaging, photography has become increasingly decoupled from human agency and human vision, i have also suggested that even those images that have been taken by the human entail a nonhuman element.

William henry Fox Talbot‚Äôs Lace from The Pencil of Nature, 1845 ‚Äì an image that arguably hints at photog- raphy‚Äôs quintessentially algorithmic, pattern-based legacy (Batchen 2001, 169; Zylinska 2017, 182) ‚Äì remedi- ated by Joanna Zylinska via Google‚Äôs deepdream, 2018.

Novitskova took this spirit to her project, If Only You Could See What I‚Äôve Seen with Your Eyes (fig. 13)
Novitskova‚Äôs work offers a pre-monition of the world to come, a world in which not only the majority of images are not being taken with a human viewer in mind ‚Äì an issue that preoccupies Trevor paglen too ‚Äì but also one in which machines constantly perceive, communicate with and exist for other machines. Lykkeberg describes Novitskova‚Äôs project as looking as if it had been ‚Äòmade by and for who‚Äôs next‚Äô (40). We could therefore perhaps suggest that, draw- ing on nonhuman databases and modes of perception, Novitskova creates work for an artificial intelligence which is not here yet, inviting a speculation on the future of different species. This is ai read as another intelligence. in this context, her extinction diagrams copied from the internet gain a new dimension ‚Äì and a new audience.

Yet many of the more interesting works, amongst which i locate novitskova‚Äôs project, do attempt to enact a defamiliarisation of not just ‚Äòthe environment‚Äô (by showing it as damaged, disappear- ing or already gone) but also of us humans as recipients

Intelligent work on artificial intelligence could therefore perhaps attempt to sever that link between the work of art and human vision, going beyond the mere aesthesis of human experience to open up the problem of the universe itself as sentient. ‚Äòit is not the case that we begin life as observing, representing beings who then become through receptivity. rather, in the beginning is a dynamic and world-oriented receptivity from which organised cognition, and the sense of the self as subject or man emerges. it is from a primary open- ness to the world, a primarily sensed world, that there emerges the sense of one who sees‚Äô (colebrook 2014, 20)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

üìÖ In the second week, I continued reading books and literature. Here are some excerpts from my reading:
"Our understanding of AI is shaped by commercial interests; they instill fear of AI in us to protect their profits. This book aims to change this mindset. One way to alter the essence of these relationships is to change how we think about intelligence: what it is, how it functions in the world, and who possesses it. Beyond the narrow frameworks offered by tech companies and the doctrine of human uniqueness (the idea that human intelligence is singular and superior among all beings), there lies an entire realm of different ways of thinking and being intelligent. The task of this book is to reimagine: to look beyond ourselves and our own creations, to glimpse other or many different kinds of intelligence that have always been here, right in front of us ‚Äì in many cases, before us. By doing so, we might change our way of thinking about the world, thereby paving the way for a future that is less extractive, destructive, and unequal, and more just, kind, and regenerative."

"In recent decades, a very different imagination of intelligence has been underway. On one hand, from the biological and behavioral sciences; on the other, from a growing appreciation and integration of indigenous and non-Western knowledge systems, this new way of understanding intelligence runs counter to the narratives of singularity and greed. More importantly, for our story, it challenges the notion that intelligence is unique and even particularly 'human.'"

Establishing new relationships with non-human intelligence.

The Turing Test defines AI as that which can imitate humans, but should we confront AI and grant it rights? Human judgments of intelligence are based on human standards. The mirror test. 
Science is understanding a human-centered world in a human-centered way.

üìÖ In the third week, I continued reading books and literature. Here are some excerpts from my reading:
Somewhere between these two extremes ‚Äì between the plant pot and the continental forest, between the microchip and the satellite ‚Äì lies our actual lived experience, the place where our shared umwelts meet and mingle. For surely, as much as we differ, there must be points of overlap in our awareness, our sense of the world, which provide an opening to understanding. This turned out to be the case with my self-driving car; it was what Barbara Smuts discovered with the baboons. To understand a little of what plants mean and why they matter, we must discover what we have in common: the ways in which we share a world.
One way we might do this is to ask what plants hear. This simple question is already rife with contestation ‚Äì plants have no ears or other known receptors for sound waves. And yet, quite assuredly, they hear, as we shall prove. How they do so, what they do with that information, and what it means for our interrelationships are similar questions to those we ask ourselves about animal intelligence: how are we changed by encountering non-human senses and a non-human impression of the world?‚Äù

üìÖ In the fourth week, I was in the midst of moving üè†.


### September 2023
üìÖ Week 1 Thought Fragments üß©:
Artists create concepts, but what do robots view? Emotions?
How to resist unconscious combinations?
AI as an extension of humans.
Text segmentation extends infinitely, while images highlight features and pixels.
Humans creating art for AI without using AI.
Art for AI viewing and the world through AI‚Äôs eyes (serving humans) are two distinct concepts.
Steganography: hiding information in artworks, like two identical images seen differently by AI.
Artwork references: https://www.fluate.net/en/travaux/vectoglyph, http://guillaumeslizewicz.com/posts/2020/i_can_remember/, https://www.aiartonline.com/design/masaru-mizuochi/

üìÖ Week 2: Went on a trip üõ´

üìÖ Week 3: I planned to present artworks as seen by AI, experimenting with the Stable Diffusion model.
https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-stable-diffusion-ai-to-create-amazing-images/
Keras, https://keras.io/examples/generative/random_walks_with_stable_diffusion/

https://hackernoon.com/latent-space-visualization-deep-learning-bits-2-bd09a46920df
I attempted to run the original code of the Stable Diffusion model, but I was unsuccessful in printing the latent space. I then looked into some codes for t-SNE to visualize the latent space in AI models. However, this essentially serves humans and does not align with the concept of ‚ÄúAI as the audience.‚Äù Finally, I continued to consider other methods for my art experiment.‚Äã‚Äã

üìÖ Week 4: Fell ill üò∑, no progress on the project.
