üìÖ In the first week, I determined the project theme and established contact with my supervisor, Adam Cole. Here is the initial project concept I wrote: In the second week, I scheduled our first meeting with Adam and prepared for it.

I want to continue researching "AI as an Art Audience" based on my previous paper. If you're interested, please visit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/45cheoq7m0bvucc/Final%20essay-Yutian%20Wei.pdf?dl=0
From a Post-humanist perspective, the line between non-human and human is blurred. However, most artworks today are created for human viewers. I believe considering non-human entities as art audiences will bring new possibilities, elevating AI from a tool to a viewer itself. I have two ideas now: 1.Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially involving the differences in how different AI models perceive things. 2.Presenting the content that AI could potentially "see" to humans. This allows humans to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship. The artwork may involve a combination of AI algorithms, VR, and other techniques.

üìÖ In the second week, I chose art experimentation as my research methodology, primarily focusing on the different cognition between AI and human beings. The artwork might take the form of an interactive installation:
1. Making AI respond to artworks through code, potentially exploring how different AI models perceive things differently.
2.Presenting the content that AI could "see" to humans, allowing them to experience art from the AI's perspective, leading to unconventional reflections on their relationship.
I believe that human understanding of AI is likely one-sided, and I cannot truly approach their way of thinking. On the technical side, I researched t-SNE (https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). I also referred to the art piece Bec0m1ng (https://www.posthumanart.com/post/bec0m1ng-a-speculative-exploration-of-ai-beyond-cognition-and-towards-presence), which consists of a digital environment with a fixed amount of matter and a group of AI agents.

üìÖ In the third week, I met with Adam to discuss my ideas. He advised me to consider specific research questions and recommended related artworks AICCA (https://hypebeast.com/2023/6/aicca-robotic-dog-mario-klingemann-coleccion-solo) and the scholar Joanna (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/joanna-zylinska, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASV6Hjd2bY). We also discussed what genres of art AI audiences would view. Lastly, I read the submission requirements for the graduation project.

üìÖ In the fourth week, I read articles written by Joanna and watched videos. Here are the key terms I wrote during my thought process:
AI Aesthetics, evaluating the quality of artworks
Objective: Humans should treat AI equally and broaden their perspectives
Art from the AI's point of view or AI's response to art
Presenting art through the AI's eyes (the process)
An AI system's "cognition" is entirely dependent on its programming and training data, and they can only perform well in specific tasks.
Most current ML artworks use AI as a tool for artistic effects. I aim to make AI both the subject and purpose of art, creating artworks for AI. However, AI may not truly appreciate art; my goal is for the audience to treat non-human entities equally and include them as service recipients rather than just as tools.
How to transform artworks into a form that AI can appreciate?
AI sees the form but not the content
I make artworks for AI, AI makes artworks for itself
One-dimensional: sound, sequence; Two-dimensional: image; Three-dimensional: space; Multi-dimensional
Through AI, we can uncover hidden structures in one-dimensional data, then display and analyze these structures in higher-dimensional spaces.
AI's shared language: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/what-an-ais-non-human-language-actually-looks-like/530934/, https://thenewstack.io/ai-bots-create-language-communicate/

Questions:
What aspects of artworks can AI appreciate? Form/Pattern/Meaning/Emotion/Similarity.
What forms can AI perceive? Digital/High-dimensional structures/Hidden information.
Is AI viewing art generated by AI or by humans?
How can artworks be transformed into a form that AI can appreciate?
In my work, should I borrow and transform famous artworks or create new pieces for transformation?
Will the visible form of artworks differ for different AI models?
Meaningless images‚Äîrevealed through AI algorithm processing.
What are non-human made AIs like, such as crows?
What type of artworks attract AI the most? Those with strong contrasts, sequences, specific frequencies, highly regular or irregular patterns.
Is the AI's generation process also a viewing process?

AI's aesthetic assessment relies on datasets, which may lead to biases.
The visual presentation and textual description of an artwork, when separately analyzed and understood by AI, could result in significantly different interpretations (the division in understanding the artwork and the description).


### July 2023
üìÖ In the first week of July, I had my second meeting with Adam. Here is the outline of my report: 
Research question: Exploring the presentation forms of artworks when AI acts as an art audience.
Research methodology: Art experiments.
From the perspective of the form of artwork presentation:
1„ÄÅHow to transform artworks into a form that AI can understand?
2„ÄÅExperiment with creating art in the forms of images, text, and music that only AI can understand. They are meaningless in human world but meaningful in AI world

From the perspective of AI's feedback results: 
1„ÄÅWhat type of work attracts AI the most? Those with high contrast, sequential, specific frequencies, highly regular or irregular ones? different with human preference. 
2„ÄÅAI‚Äôs aesthetic evaluation depends on datasets, which may lead to biases. 
3„ÄÅFor an artwork's visual presentation and textual description, separate analyses and understanding by AI might lead to vastly different results. For AI, perhaps words are more specific and easier to understand? 
4„ÄÅDoes AI understand human-created art and AI-generated art differently? Extended thinking: Could AI potentially create art for itself?
Relevant work: Color of Words (https://genekogan.com/works/color-of-words/)
Technical references: t-SNE: https://mlart.co/?page=1&search=t-SNE, https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/

Adam recommended the work Botto (https://www.botto.com/) and the books Ways of Being (https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being/) and AI Art (http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/ai-art/). He suggested I frame my thesis question as, "How can novel forms of artistic presentation help humans understand AI, with AI as the audience?" Technically, he advised me to try GANs, Autoencoders, and Diffusion models, and perhaps print out the latent space from the Diffusion models.

üìÖ The second week I went on a trip. üõ´
üìÖ In the third week, I read the book AI Art: Machine Visions and Warped Dreams. Here are some excerpts from my reading:
Does art exist outside the clearly designated realm of human cultural practice? Will ai create new conditions and new audiences for art? What will art ‚Äòafter‚Äô ai look like? Who will be its recipient?
Questions of originality and of the genius of an individual producer are hence framed by a study of the wider context that produces conditions for the emergence of a particular art form ‚Äì and that produces particular audiences which can identify, interpret and engage with that art form. These questions are therefore framed through what Michel Foucault has called an ‚Äòauthor function‚Äô (1992, 306): a wider discursive arrangement that stabilises into what a given cultural moment perceives as an ‚Äòauthor‚Äô or ‚Äòartist‚Äô.
call ‚Äòai imitation work‚Äô, also known as ‚Äòstyle transfer‚Äô. This mode of artistic production departs from the classical conceptualisation of art in terms of mimesis, i.e. the imitation of nature and its representation. For aristotle, all art was mimetic, but mimesis, proceeding by addition and not just repetition, involved what we would today call a ‚Äòremediation‚Äô (Bolter and Grusin 2002) of nature. it was thus a form of creative engagement, although one that was not yet linked to the humanist notions of originality and genius. Unlike mimesis, ‚Äòstyle transfer‚Äô is pure mimicry: a belaboured resemblance which is also a masquerade. in the context of the ai industry, where much of this kind of mimicry art is being produced, we need to ask: what underpins those efforts and what is it they actually attempt to masquerade as?
The ‚Äòcomputer‚Äô, be it in the shape of a data-processing machine, a robot or an algorithm, is only seen here as an imperfect approximation of such a human. But, in light of the argument laid out here, we should rather be asking, after Flusser, whether the human can actually be creative, or, more precisely: in what way can the human be creative?
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

üìÖ In the fourth week, I continued reading books and literature. Here are some excerpts from my reading:
Dukaj goes so far as to suggest that, in the times of ai, human life is the only auratic form of art left to us, especially the way it escapes the digital record- ing and preprogrammed behaviour. he is not talking here about some unmediated encounter between two humans outside the technological setup or evoking similar humanist fantasies. it is the YouTube stars, pub- licising their lives and the branded products that shape them, that are for him the last artists of today, turn- ing lifestyle into an aesthetic experience while also externalising the knowledge about what it means to be human, and to behave like a human being, into the globally interconnected computer network. 
This form of art enforces what Berardi has described as ‚Äòmental subsumption‚Äô (2017), whereby the automation of vision and of cognitive activity paves the way for the emergence of constantly stimulated yet passive subjectivity. it thus ultimately works in the service of neoliberal- ism, a mutated form of capitalism that, according to Byungchul han, ‚Äòhas discovered the psyche as a productive force‚Äô. Yet what gets produced here is ‚Äòmental optimisation‚Äô (han 2017), for which Big data, algorithms and ai serve as perfect conduits. han calls this state of events a psychopolitics, which is his variation on Foucault‚Äôs notion of biopolitics, whereby the subject mobilises technologies of the self not to create any forms of freedom but rather to succumb, ‚Äòwillingly ‚Äì and even passionately‚Äô (2017), to auto-exploitation (fig. 9)
seeing like a Machine, Telling like a human
What is new about the FereT images is that they are not aimed at human eyes: as a training set for a facial recognition algorithm, their goal is to establish this commonality-in-difference for machine vision. indeed, these images are not meant to be seen at all by humans but are rather going inside the black box that ai has become. The fact that most ai research has been funded by the military, with darpa, the original funders of internet development, also sponsoring ‚Äòmore ai research than private corporations and any other branch of the government‚Äô (Barrat 2013, 180)
